Serendipity
==========
This project started life as an honours programming project...and hasn't (at time of writing) been touched since, despite a world of good intentions to fix a lot of glaring issues with it.

The premise behind this project was to build the "Serendipitous City Guide" -- which would allow users to freely explore a city but provide notifications if they moved within configurable proximity of attractions they had an interest in seeing.
A poster using the result of this project was submitted to the [MobileHCI '11 conference][1].
